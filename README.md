# Tailwind: custom web UI with Tailwind


## UI-Tailwind-Boilerplate: Quick Start

This repository has been set-up with support for Tailwind CSS. Please follow the setup instructions below to use the boilerplate correctly:


1. Upon cloning the repository, go into the project directory and Install the required dev-dependencies by running

   ```
       npm install
   ```


2.  To start using the project, run the watch command. This would compile your `input.css` file to `output.css` in the `dist` folder.

    ```
        npm run tailwind:watch
    ```

    This starts the Tailwind CLI build process<br>
    **Note: You still need to use the live-server (Go Live) extension to preview your HTML. To stop the watch-mode simply press `ctrl + c`**


## Task

Navigate to the **Tailwind Design Challenge** folder in Figma under the **UXUI_0124** group.

Look at the mockups of the landing pages in the **Landing Pages** file [https://www.figma.com/file/giEYoDbIruXjAdjm3ilnvl/Landing-Pages?type=design&mode=design&t=IhwabhxKqwiDfEBt-1](https://www.figma.com/file/giEYoDbIruXjAdjm3ilnvl/Landing-Pages?type=design&mode=design&t=IhwabhxKqwiDfEBt-1)

Using Tailwind, build the landing page for the design of the **DocBank** landing page.

### Bonus
If you done with DocBank landing page you can work on other mockups in the figma file:
* Blog section UI piece,
* Landing for the analytic platform, or
* Try to reproduce with Tailwind any piece of UI of your liking that you find interesting on the web.

**Remember to commit and push often. Enjoy!**
